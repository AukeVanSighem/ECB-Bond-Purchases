# ECB-Bond-Purchases

## Introduction
The European Central Bank has been buying corporate bonds since 2015. This signifies an important cash injection in the European Economy. The ECB started buying assets from commercial banks as part of its non-standard monetary policy measures. These asset purchases, also known as quantitative easing or QE, support economic growth across the euro area and helps Europe to return to inflation levels below, but close to, 2%.

## Proposed Research Question
