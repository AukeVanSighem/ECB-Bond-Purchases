### Data
The data used for the project can be found in the S3 bucket (https://226127163243.signin.aws.amazon.com/console, s3groupsweden) in the _Data_ folder. Data that is pulled upon running is stored locally in the folder _output_ to have faster acces to the data if you run the same functions again.
